This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and involves an unexpected behavior during the build process or interactions with the development server.  The exact error message varies, but it often involves issues with dependencies, asset handling, or native modules. This isn't a common, well-documented error, making debugging challenging. For example, a seemingly innocuous change to your project's configuration could trigger it.
