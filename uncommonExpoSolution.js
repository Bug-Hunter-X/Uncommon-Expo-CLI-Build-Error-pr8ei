The solution to this error is highly context-dependent and requires careful examination of the full error message and project setup.  However, some common strategies are:

1. **Verify Dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies are compatible with the Expo SDK version you're using.  Check `package.json` for any conflicting versions or outdated packages. Run `expo install` to update. 
2. **Clean and Rebuild:** Delete your `node_modules` folder and then run `npm install` or `yarn install`.  After installing, clear the Expo cache with `expo start --clear`. 
3. **Check Asset Handling:** If the error relates to assets (images, fonts), verify that they are correctly referenced and accessible in your project.  Incorrect paths or file formats are common causes. 
4. **Examine Native Modules:** If you are using any native modules, ensure that they are correctly configured and linked to your project. Review the module's documentation for specific setup instructions. 
5. **Consult the Expo Documentation:** Carefully read the official Expo documentation for troubleshooting tips and known issues related to your specific setup or error messages.  
6. **Inspect Expo Logs:** Scrutinize the complete Expo CLI output for any hints.  Often, the root cause is buried in earlier warnings or error messages that might seem unrelated to the final error.
