# Uncommon Expo CLI Build Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI. The error is characterized by inconsistent and unpredictable behavior during the build or development server start process.  The specific error message varies widely, often related to dependency resolution, asset handling, or interaction with native modules.  This issue is not frequently reported, making it challenging to diagnose and resolve.
